# Iris-Flower-Classification
The Iris flower classification problem involves categorizing Iris flowers into three species—*Iris setosa*, *Iris versicolor*, and *Iris virginica*—based on four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. Using a labeled dataset, the goal is to build a machine learning model that accurately predicts the species.
